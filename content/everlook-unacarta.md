With this song I was confronted with a genre that I wasn't very familiar with. At first I underestimated it and, when I understood that it was not as I thought, I began a process of learning and internalizing the genre. 

## Mix

There is a lot of tracks in this song due to many instruments that are playing at the same time or different sections. I decided treat these as I usually do: As capes. Starting with some treatment in individual tracks and continuing unifying main instruments or same instrument and ending with three main groups that are going to the stereo bus: A rythmical, a musical and a vocal bus.

Proper low end, hugeness in drums and clean vocals is what I tried to achieve in this mix.

I also decided to treat some sections of the song with more creative freedom to achieve what that section was offering, such as doubling vocals and subtle autopanning instruments in more ethereal parts of the song.

### Master

I used the mastering phase to achieve standard industry volumes and a more rounded mix by clipping, glue compressing, a little EQ and limiting
