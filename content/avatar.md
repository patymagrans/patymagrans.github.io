## Sound replacement by the use of Foley

My job was to design the sound for the 10-second videoclip animation intro for 'AP' by Blessd. It was my first job of this kind. My experience in this area came from practice at university.

### Process

Ambience is an essential part of every scene wich sound must be added. That is where I started: Adding an enviroment that situates the listener in time and place that the image is suggesting and sits every sound that is going to be added after.

I carfted every sound editing, stacking and processing library sounds. 

After designing all the sounds I automated filters and more effects to follow the camera's POV and give that proximity/remoteness effect.

I made more complete versions with more sounds but I don't know why they decided to put an incomplete version to the music video.
