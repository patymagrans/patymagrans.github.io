## Sound replacement by the use of Foley

In this scene from the movie Avatar I decided to replace the sound by challenging myself to use mostly sounds recorded by me (foley).

### Process

This scene is set in a jungle of a world remote from ours. With these initial environmental characteristics, I developed a sound environment that places the characters and the audience in relation to the image. For this, I recorded sounds of plants in motion, recorded my voice, and edited to achieve sounds of alien animals, and also used library sounds to finish crafting.

The sounds of the characters are mostly recorded by doing foley: from movements to breaths.
