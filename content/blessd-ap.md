## Animated intro for videoclip

#### My job in this project was to make the sound of the 10-second animated videoclip intro for 'AP' by Blessd.

### Process

Ambience is an essential part of every scene wich sound must be added. That is where I started: Adding an enviroment that situates the listener in time and place that the image is suggesting and sits every sound that is going to be added after.

I carfted every sound editing, stacking and processing library sounds. Non of the sounds that I used was ready-to-go samples, not because I wanted to take the time to edit, this scene really needed something different from what ready-to-go samples were offering.

#### Conflicts during the process
