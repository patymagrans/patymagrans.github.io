## Animated intro for videoclip

In the music video for 'Fendi & Valentino' by Blessd I had to design the sound of the 10-second animated intro. This was my third job and a similar approach to 'AP' and 'Vice'.

### Process

This animation proposed a scenario with the atmosphere and ambience of a boxing gym. I decided to start working by recreating this space in which the viewer had to be placed.

I carfted every sound editing, stacking and processing library sounds. 

After designing all the sounds I automated filters and more effects to follow the camera's POV and give that proximity/remoteness effect.
