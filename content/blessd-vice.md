## Animated intro for videoclip

My job was to design the sound for a 10-second animation for the intro of Blessd's 'VIce' music video. This was my second job and a similar proposal to 'AP'.

### Process

This animation proposed another scenario with a different atmosphere and ambience. The scene was set in a garage. When it came to working, I also started there: Recreating the environment that was proposed. 

I carfted every sound editing, stacking and processing library sounds.

After designing all the sounds I automated filters and more effects to follow the camera's POV and give that proximity/remoteness effect.

This time they put the right and complete version to the official videoclip.
